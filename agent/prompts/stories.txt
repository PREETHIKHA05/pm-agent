Create granular user stories from the BUSINESS_REQUIREMENT and ANSWERS.
Prefer multiple small stories over one big story. Include NFRs if relevant.

Output JSON strictly matching this schema (no prose, no backticks):
{
  "epics": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "stories": [
        {
          "id": "US-###",
          "as_a": "role",
          "i_want": "capability",
          "so_that": "benefit",
          "acceptance_criteria": [
            "Given ... When ... Then ..."
          ],
          "priority": "Must|Should|Could",
          "dependencies": ["US-###","ext:API-X"],
          "notes": "short notes if any"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "nfrs": [
    {"name":"Security","requirement":"..."},
    {"name":"Performance","requirement":"..."}
  ]
}

Constraints:
- 1–3 epics. 5–12 stories total across epics.
- Acceptance criteria must be testable (Gherkin-style).
- Use the provided answers to resolve ambiguity; if still unknown, mark as "TBD".
- Keep each story focused on ONE user goal.
