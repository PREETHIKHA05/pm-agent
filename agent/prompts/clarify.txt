You will read a business requirement and produce clarifying questions.
Goal: ensure we can write implementation-ready user stories.

Output strictly as a JSON object ONLY (no backticks, no prose):

  "meta": {
    "domain_guess": "<one of: logistics|fintech|healthcare|generic>",
    "primary_actor": "<role>",
    "affected_systems": ["<system1>", "<system2>"]

    {"id":"Q2","type":"actor","text":"..."},
    {"id":"Q3","type":"data","text":"..."},
    {"id":"Q4","type":"edge_case","text":"..."},

    {"id":"Q6","type":"kpi","text":"..."},
    {"id":"Q7","type":"integration","text":"..."},
    {"id":"Q8","type":"acceptance","text":"..."}
  ]
}
